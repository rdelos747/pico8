# pico8

backups for all of my pico8 games :)

## Source Control

I have a bash command that runs the following:

```
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/pico-8/carts
git add *
git commit -m "`date`"
git push origin master
```

## Tips

### Exporting cartridge

- `fn+f2` to capture cart image
- `export cart-name.bin` to get app

### Gifs

- `fn+f9` to capture last 8 seconds as a gif
